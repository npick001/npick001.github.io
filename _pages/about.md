I am a Simulator Engineer at Westinghouse Electric Company and a graduate student in Modeling and Simulation Engineering at ODU. I love hiking, climbing, and exploring. As a dedicated student, I found a deep appreciation for time and project management, dedication, and professional flexibility.

##### **Academics**
My academic journey has centered around harnessing the power of dynamic simulation modeling and analysis. This expertise spans across various domains, enabling me to develop comprehensive simulation models that accurately capture and analyze complex systems.

##### **My Simulation Worldview**
My approach to simulation is rooted in flexibility and adaptability. I focus on understanding the unique aspects of each system, ensuring that the simulation models I create are not only accurate but highly relevant to the specific challenges and objectives at hand. This allows me to offer tailored insights and solutions, significantly impacting and optimizing processes and decision-making strategies.

##### **Versitility**
Through my studies and experiences, I have gained a deep appreciation for the nuances of dynamic systems. Whether analyzing traffic flow, optimizing industrial processes, exploring new technological applications, setting up nuclear reactor simulators, I have applied my simulation skills to a broad range of scenarios. This versatility is not just a professional asset; it's a personal passion that drives my continuous learning and application in the ever-evolving field of simulation engineering.
